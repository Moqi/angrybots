  /**
   * \brief IAchievements is an interface for listing all of a user's achievements.
   *
   * Achievements are created in Roar by setting a task and defining a number of completion
   * events. Once a user has completed the tasks the prescribed number of times, the achievement
   * is rewarded.
   *
   * You can get the list of all achievements via the #list function or
   * a single achievement via the #getAchievement function.
   *
   * An achievement is represented in a Hashtable using the following keys:
   *
   * \code
   *   - ikey : "the_big_one"
   *   - status : "active"
   *   - label : "The Big One"
   *   - progress : "0/3"
   *   - description "Find the dragon three times!"
   *   - task_ikey : "an_ikey"
   *   - task_label : "A task label"
   * \endcode
   *
