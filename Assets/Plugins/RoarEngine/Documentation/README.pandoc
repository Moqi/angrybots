# Roar Unity Plugin

<!-- Description of Roar from the web page -->
Roar’s award-winning development platform, the RoarEngine offers game
developers and development studios a unique toolset for rapid backend
development of cross platform social and casual games.  The core system is
powered by a rich game mechanics engine which allows developers to create
complex functionality including:  creating and managing virtual goods,
developing quests and tasks, integrating badges, achievements and leaderboards,
and earning real revenue through premium virtual currency sales.   With
RoarEngine, developers focus on making games fun, engaging and profitable
rather than on building complex technical backend systems.  Cloud-based, the
RoarEngine offers true cross platform game development and distribution on all
platfirms including:  (need list)  Roar takes development times of months, even
years to weeks and days.

<!-- description of the plugin -->
The Roar Unity plugin makes adding these features to your game easy.
You can add leaderboards, shops, server authorative stats and more.

## Quick-start

This is meant to explain how to create the test scene usually found in the
`dev` folder of the Unity3D project. The test scene is a very simple scene that
utilizes a few widgets and can make calls to the roar engine using these
widgets.  This document should be updated as and when the test scene itself is
updated with new features added to the Unity3D Roar plugin.

It is convenient to have the login module to activate on startup for the purposes of this scene. 
The module is automatically created by default under the main Roar systems object. 
The exact path in the scene hierarchy is Roar/RoarUI/Login. Select this gameobject 
and uncheck the ‘disable on awake’ option to have the module be enabled when you startup.

You start off with an empty scene and nothing but a camera. To begin you need
to add the main Roar system object. You do this through the Unity menu
(`GameObject`$\to$`Create Other`$\to$`Roar`$\to$`System Object`). If this menu is not available
it means you are missing the Assets/Editor/Roarengine/RoarObjectFactory.cs
file. This will create a system object in your scene and this object is what
you use to configure Roar. You need to enter your game key in the `Game Key`
section here. This is the key that all calls using the Unity plugin will use.

You can now begin dropping widgets into your game. Widgets are small scripts
that can be configured to display information from the roar server. You can
create a widget either by going to the menu at the top and selecting
(`GameObject`$\to$`Create Other`$\to$`Roar`$\to$). This will create an empty game object in
your scene with the selected widget script attached. Currently the Stats,
Rankings, Leaderboards, Shop and Friends list widgets are available. 

If the widget you are looking for is not available in this menu and is in your
project you can manually drop it onto any game object by looking for the .cs
file and dragging it onto an empty game object. 

Widgets that are created can be configured by tweaking the custom inspector
available when selecting a widget. There are some common properties of all
widgets such as whether they are a dragable window and their alignments on the
screen. At the bottom are custom properties based on the type of widget
selected. Look out for warnings and alerts from the inspector window such as
content bounds with width and height being 0. 

Finally you need a way to trigger the widgets to enable and disable them. The
test scene uses 3d rotating cubes that when clicked on will toggle the
`enabled` property of the widget script on the gameobject. You can use any
means to enable and disable scripts but avoid using GUI as they could interfere
with the GUI of the widgets itself. A script like this will cause the widget
component/script to toggle between enable and disable on clicking on it:

~~~{.cs}
void OnMouseDown() {
 target.GetComponent<RoarLeaderboardsWidget>().enabled = ! target.GetComponent<RoarLeaderboardsWidget>().enabled;
 }
~~~

`target` is the gameobject that holds the widget itself. Make sure the game
object that holds this fragment has a collider attached to it. 

## Styling widgets

### Positioning the widgets

The overall position of each widget is controlled by several factors.
The initial dimensions and position are controlled by the `bounds` variable.
If alignment is set to something other than `None` then `bounds" are modified to
respect that alignment. Finally any offset values are applied.

The actual *content* of the widget is then contained within a region inside the
`bounds` called `contentBounds` (The positioning of `contentBounds` is relative
to `bounds` and if set to `(0,0,0,0)` will default to the entirity of `bounds`.

### Positioning and styling the contents

The contents of each widget can be controlled through the use of a GUI skin.
Each of the widgets contents is made from a variety of components each skinable
and positionable independantly.

GUI skins contain texture, text and positioning information for each component state.
Through customising the skin you can make the roar widgets look however you like.

## How to use the low level code

Before the Roar SDK can be used, it has to be properly installed.
Please, follow these instructions.

1. The latest Roar.unityPackage can be downloaded from 
https://github.com/roarengine/sdks/downloads 
and imported into a newly created or existing unity project.

2. Run the Unity Editor and open the project that you wish to use Roar with or create a new one.

3. Import the Roar Unity sdk package via the menu item at
Assets->Import Package->Custom Package...

4. Ensure that all files are selected for import and click 'Import'.
This will add a Plugins/Roar folder to your project.

5. Next create a Roar game object via the menu item at
Game Object->Create Other->Roar->Scene Object

6. To begin using the Roar SDK, set the game key. This is the same
name that you used when you created the game from the Roar Admin.
e.g. http://api.roar.io/yourgamekey

At this point you will be able to make calls to IRoar to interact with the roar server.



### How the code is structured



#### Widgets
#### Cache / DataModel
### Roar Object Layer

The communication with the Roar Server can be done through an instance of an IRoar class.
You can obtain it from the DefaultRoar as in the code example below.

~~~{.cs}
using UnityEngine;

public class MyClass : MonoBehaviour
{
	IRoar roar = null;
	
	public void SomeFunction ()
	{
		roar = DefaultRoar.Instance;
	}
}
~~~

Once you have obtained the access to the roar object, you can start communicating with the Roar Server.

Please note, however, that calls to the roar object do not return anything.
You can obtain the results from the server by either setting up an event handler or by providing a callback function.
Some interface functions fire events, some others accept callbacks. In cases where a function supports both event and callback, the choice is yours.

#### Callbacks

Using a callback is quite simple. All you need to do is write a callback methods (OnLogin in our case) and pass it to the roar interface call.
In this case we use the Login method, which accepts the user name, password and the callback.
Once the result comes from the server, this callback is activated.

Please observe, the type of the result is Roar.WebObjects.User.LoginResponse.
It contains several fields, such as code and msg.
If code = 200 then the login was successful.
Otherwise, the code and msg fields indicate the reason for failure.

The next two sections examine these two approaches in detail.
Since the IRoar.Login function support both methods it is easy to compare them.


~~~{.cs}
using UnityEngine;

public class MyLoginClass : MonoBehaviour
{
	IRoar roar = null;
	
	public void Start ()
	{
		roar = DefaultRoar.Instance;
	}
	
	public void OnLogin (Roar.CallbackInfo<Roar.WebObjects.User.LoginResponse> info)
	{
		if (info.code == 200)
		{
			Debug.Log ("Login Successful!");
		} else {
			Debug.Log ("Login Failed (reason: " + info.msg + ")!");
		}
	}
	
	public void OnMouseDown ()
	{
		roar.Login("my_user_name", "my_password", OnLogin);
	}
}
~~~

#### Events

There are few difference between providing a callback and setting up an event.

* The callback method is now split into two different methods: OnLoginSuccess and OnLoginFailure.
* These events accapt different arguments than Roar.WebObjects.User.LoginResponse. In particular, OnLoginFailure accepts a string indicating the reson, while OnLoginSuccess does not accept anything.
* The IRoar.Login call passes the null value in place of the callback method.
* Both events have to be registered through the RoarManager.



~~~{.cs}
using UnityEngine;

public class MyLoginClass : MonoBehaviour
{
	IRoar roar = null;
	
	public void Start ()
	{
		roar = DefaultRoar.Instance;
		RoarManager.loggedInEvent += OnLoginSuccess;
		RoarManager.logInFailedEvent += OnLoginFailure;
	}
	
	public void OnLoginSuccess ()
	{
		Debug.Log ("SUCCESS");
	}
	
	public void OnLoginFailure (string reason)
	{
		Debug.Log ("FAILURE (reason = " + reason + ")");
	}
	
	public void OnMouseDown ()
	{
		roar.Login("my_user_name", "my_password", null);
	}
}
~~~

The most recent definition of all events and their parameters can be found in src/Assets/Plugins/RoarEngine/RoarManager.cs source file.

## Building on iOS

To make the roar SDK work on iOS, you need to switch to iOS deployment and build.
The first build will fail, however it will generate and open an XCode project
for you. You will then need to copy all .h and .m files from
src/Assets/Plugins/RoarEngine/StoreKit/NativeIOS/ into the Classes folder of
resulting Xcode project.

Then building should succeed ( Assuming you have set up the 
device signing certificates required by XCode ).
