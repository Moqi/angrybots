How to setup the RoarIO AngryBots demo project in Unity
-------------------------------------------------------

PART 1: Import of project Assets

To try out the AngryBots RoarIO demo applica:tion 3 artifacts are required.

1. The AngryBots Unity package from the Unity Asset store
http://u3d.as/content/unity-technologies/angry-bots/2aL

2. The latest AngryBots RoarIO Unity package from
http://roar.io/clients/unity/demo/

3. The latest stable RoarIO client Unity package from
http://roar.io/clients/unity/releases/

The process is simple, first you import the AngryBots unity package into a new Unity project,
at this stage you should run the demo via the play button to ensure the vanilla demo is
functioning as expected.

The next step is to import the AngryBots RoarIO Unity package via the menu item at
Assets->Import Package->Custom Package...

This package contains source code to augment the original AngryBots tech demo.

Finally you will need to import the RoarIO Unity client package via the menu item at
Assets->Import Package->Custom Package...

PART 2: 

After you have imported the various Unity packages into your project, you will need to
setup two empty game objects to attach a series of scripts.

First open the AngryBots scene by double-clicking it from within the Project panel (it's the
one with the black and white Unity icon).

Next create an empty game object and name it Roar via the menu item at
Game Object->Create Empty

From the Project panel, drag the RoarIO.cs file within the Plugins/RoarIO/ folder onto the Roar game object.

Next create an empty game object and name it RoarDemo via the menu item at
Game Object->Create Empty

Then drag and drop the following scripts from the Project panel onto the RoarDemo game object.

Demo/RoarDemo.js
Demo/EquipmentManager.js
Demo/ConfirmBox.js
Standard assets/GameScore.js

Select the RoarDemo game object in the Hierarchy panel

The Inspector panel will show the scripts that are attached to the RoarDemo game object,
note the RoarDemo script has a number of public variables exposed, including Pause Icon and Demo Skin. 
By clicking the Asset selector found at the right most region of each variable row (it looks like a tiny
circle), set the Pause Icon to the Pause texture and set the Demo Skin to the DemoGUISkin.

You are now ready to run the demo :)
